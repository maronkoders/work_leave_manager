I am owner of www.go4expert.com for more than a decade now and have been doing a lot of XYZ development. Apart from my own
 forum, I have clients like ABC, DEF and GHI where I have been a developer recently. Needless to say but you can also see my PeoplePerHour profile for the feedback for XYZ jobs.

I can start on your project immediately and let me know if you want to discuss anything further with me.

Thanks
Brian Thomas
